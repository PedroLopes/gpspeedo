# gpspeedo
A GPS speedometer for android. Very simple and neat.
This is based on p.a.warren's project on google code (abandoned so I cloned it, as an attempt to keep it alive -- at least for personal use on my android device)

# original README from p.a.warren
This project has been abandoned, I don't really have the time or energy to keep it going. Feel free to fork and do whatever you like with it, it's GPL3 after all :)

It does still work with android 4.2, with some oddness around soft buttons and button backlights.

A simple Speedometer for Android, with HUD capability and units selection.

Uses the built in GPS capabilities of Android handsets.
